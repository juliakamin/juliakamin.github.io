Hello. I'm  a researcher who works with organizations that leverage social science to foster social cohesion both on and off line. 

Today, I spend most of my time as the Managing Director of [Prosocial Design Network](https://www.prosocialdesign.org/), a nonprofit that promotes healthy online spaces by connecting research to practice. I'm also a research consultant with [Civic Health Project](https://www.civichealthproject.org/), where I help organizations that are working to bridge divides in the US measure their impact.  

I'm passionate about making research relevant, connecting researchers and practitioners to both translate research to practice but also catalyze more practice-informed research. If you're on that same path, let's talk.
