Hello. I'm  a researcher who works with organizations that leverage social science to foster social cohesion both on and off line. 

Today, I spend most of my time as the Managing Director of [Prosocial Design Network](https://www.prosocialdesign.org/), a nonprofit that promotes healthy online spaces by connecting research to practice. I'm also a research consultant with [Civic Health Project](https://www.civichealthproject.org/), where I help organizations that are bridging divides [measure their impact](https://www.listenfirstproject.org/goals-and-measures).  

I'm passionate about making research relevant, connecting researchers and practitioners to both translate research to practice but also catalyze more practice-informed research. If you're on that same path, let's talk.
